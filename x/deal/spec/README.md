## Abstract

`x/deal` is a custom module, which handles business related functionality of an application specific blockchain `deal`,
built using Cosmos sdk. It is supposed to handle deals & contracts among business parties, 
specifically between online stores and vendors in this case. Unlike in traditional systems where the centralised authority 
like online stores controls the payment collection and settlement, it handles the fund related activities in a decentralised manner.
